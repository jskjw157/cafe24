You can start with simple prop-based animations before growing to layout, gesture and scroll animations.\nMotion's unique\nhybrid engine\ncombines the performance of native browser animations with the flexibility of JavaScript. It's also trusted by companies like\nFramer\nand\nFigma\nto power their amazing no-code animations and gestures.\nIn this guide, we'll learn\nwhy\nand\nwhen\nyou should use Motion, how to\ninstall\nit, and then take a whirlwind tour of its main features.\nWhy Motion for React?\nReact gives you the power to build dynamic user interfaces, but orchestrating complex, performant animations can be a challenge. Motion is a production-ready library designed to solve this, making it simple to create everything from beautiful micro-interactions to complex, gesture-driven animations.\n<\nmotion\n.\nbutton\nanimate\n=\n{\n{\nopacity\n:\n1\n}\n}\n/>\nKey advantages\nHereâs when itâs the right choice for your project.\nBuilt for React.\nWhile other animation libraries are messy to integrate, Motion's declarative API feels like a natural extension of React. Animations can be linked directly to state and props.\nHardware-acceleration.\nMotion leverages the same high-performance browser animations as pure CSS, ensuring your UIs stay smooth and snappy. You get the power of 120fps animations with a much simpler and more expressive API.\nAnimate anything.\nCSS has hard limits. There's values you can't animate, keyframes you can't interrupt, staggers that must be hardcoded. Motion provides a single, consistent API that handles everything from simple transitions to advanced scroll, layout, and gesture-driven effects.\nApp-like gestures.\nStandard CSS\n:hover\nevents are unreliable on touch devices. Motion provides robust, cross-device gesture recognisers for tap, drag, and hover, making it easy to build interactions that feel native and intuitive on any device.\nWhen is CSS a better choice?\nFor simple, self-contained effects (like a color change on hover) a standard CSS transition is a lightweight solution. The strength of Motion is that it can do these simple kinds of animations but also scale to anything you can imagine. All with the same easy to write and maintain API.\nInstall\nMotion is available via\nnpm\n:\nnpm\ninstall\nmotion\nFeatures can now be imported via\n\"motion/react\"\n:\nimport\n{\nmotion\n}\nfrom\n\"motion/react\"\nPrefer to install via CDN, or looking for framework-specific instructions? Check out our\nfull installation guide\n.\nYour first animation\nThe\n<motion />\ncomponent is the core API in Motion for React. It's a DOM element, supercharged with animation capabilities.\n<\nmotion\n.\nul\nanimate\n=\n{\n{\nrotate\n:\n360\n}\n}\n/>\nWhen values in\nanimate\nchange, the component will animate. Motion has intuitive defaults, but animations can of course be configured via\nthe\ntransition\nprop\n.\n<\nmotion\n.\ndiv\nanimate\n=\n{\n{\nscale\n:\n2\n,\ntransition\n:\n{\nduration\n:\n2\n}\n}\n}\n/>\nLearn more about React animation\nEnter animation\nWhen a component enters the page, it will automatically animate to the values defined in the\nanimate\nprop.\nYou can provide values to animate from via the\ninitial\nprop (otherwise these will be read from the DOM).\n<\nmotion\n.\nbutton\ninitial\n=\n{\n{\nscale\n:\n0\n}\n}\nanimate\n=\n{\n{\nscale\n:\n1\n}\n}\n/>\nOr disable this initial animation entirely by setting\ninitial\nto\nfalse\n.\n<\nmotion\n.\nbutton\ninitial\n=\n{\nfalse\n}\nanimate\n=\n{\n{\nscale\n:\n1\n}\n}\n/>\nHover & tap animation\n<motion />\nextends React's event system with powerful\ngesture animations\n. It currently supports hover, tap, focus, and drag.\n<\nmotion\n.\nbutton\nwhileHover\n=\n{\n{\nscale\n:\n1.1\n}\n}\nwhileTap\n=\n{\n{\nscale\n:\n0.95\n}\n}\nonHoverStart\n=\n{\n(\n)\n=>\nconsole\n.\nlog\n(\n'hover started!'\n)\n}\n/>\nMotion's gestures are designed to feel better than using CSS or JavaScript events alone.\nScroll animation\nMotion supports both types of\nscroll animations\n:\nScroll-triggered\nand\nscroll-linked\n.\nTo trigger an animation on scroll, the\nwhileInView\nprop defines a state to animate to/from when an element enters/leaves the viewport:\n<\nmotion\n.\ndiv\ninitial\n=\n{\n{\nbackgroundColor\n:\n\"rgb(0, 255, 0)\"\n,\nopacity\n:\n0\n}\n}\nwhileInView\n=\n{\n{\nbackgroundColor\n:\n\"rgb(255, 0, 0)\"\n,\nopacity\n:\n1\n}\n}\n/>\nWhereas to link a value directly to scroll position, it's possible to use\nMotionValue\ns via\nuseScroll\n.\nconst\n{\nscrollYProgress\n}\n=\nuseScroll\n(\n)\nreturn\n<\nmotion\n.\ndiv\nstyle\n=\n{\n{\nscaleX\n:\nscrollYProgress\n}\n}\n/>\nLayout animation\nMotion has an industry-leading\nlayout animation\nengine that supports animating between changes in layout using transforms.\nIt's as easy as applying the\nlayout\nprop.\n<\nmotion\n.\ndiv\nlayout\n/>\nOr to animate between completely different elements, a\nlayoutId\n:\n<\nmotion\n.\ndiv\nlayoutId\n=\n\"underline\"\n/>\nExit animations\nBy wrapping\nmotion\ncomponents with\n<AnimatePresence>\nwe gain access to\nexit animations\n.

      "content": "# Framer Motion Cheatsheet\n\nThis is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that demonstrates using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) to create animations in React. \n\nFramer Motion is a production-ready motion library that helps developers craft immersive user experiences by adding gestures, transitions, and animations to their web apps.\n\nThis project contains examples of Framer Motion animations like page transitions, drag gestures, scroll-based animations, animated SVG morphing, and more.  It aims to showcase the capabilities of Framer Motion in a Next.js codebase and serve as a cheatsheet for Framer Motion usage.\n\nThe project uses:\n\n- React for building UI components\n- Next.js as the React framework\n- Framer Motion for animations\n- Tailwind CSS for styling\n\nTo learn more about the implementations, view the source code in the `pages/` and `components/` directories which contain examples of:\n\n- `motion` components for animating divs \n- Layout animations\n- Drag gestures with `drag` prop\n- Keyframe-based animations\n- SVG Path animations\n\nYou can also consult the official Framer Motion and Next.js documentation for more insights.\n\nThis demo app is a great starting point for adding motion to your Next.js projects and experimenting with the animation capabilities of Framer Motion.\n\n## Live Demo\n\nYou can see a live demo of this project here: https://framer-motion-nextjs-five.vercel.app/\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo get started with this project, follow these steps:\n\n1. Clone the repository to your local machine:\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/richawo/framer-motion-nextjs.git\n    ```\n\n2. Navigate to the project directory:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd framer-motion-nextjs\n   ```\n\n3. Install the project dependencies:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install\n   # or\n   yarn install\n   # or\n   pnpm install\n   ```\n\n4. Run the development server:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm run dev\n   # or\n   yarn dev\n   # or\n   pnpm dev\n   ```\n\n5.
