#  Codex

One agent for everywhere you code

Codex is OpenAI’s coding agent for software development. It can help you:

  * **Write code** : Describe what you want to build, and Codex generates code that matches your intent, adapting to your existing project structure and conventions.

  * **Understand unfamiliar codebases** : Codex can read and explain complex or legacy code, helping you quickly grasp how systems are structured.

  * **Review code** : Codex analyzes code to identify potential bugs, logic errors, and unhandled edge cases.

  * **Debug and fix problems** : When something breaks, Codex helps trace failures, diagnose root causes, and suggest targeted fixes.

  * **Automate development tasks** : Codex can run repetitive workflows such as refactoring, testing, migrations, and setup tasks so you can focus on higher-level engineering work.
