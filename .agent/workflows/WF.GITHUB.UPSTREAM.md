# WF.GITHUB.UPSTREAM — Targeted Upstream Verification
Purpose: Use GitHub MCP surgically for upstream truth (bugs, migrations, examples).

Steps:
1) Define the exact upstream question (one sentence).
2) Search narrowly (releases/issues/PRs/examples).
3) Open only the relevant section.
4) Extract:
   - the definitive statement (paraphrase)
   - version/commit reference
   - workaround/migration steps
5) Return a minimal implementation plan + verification steps.
