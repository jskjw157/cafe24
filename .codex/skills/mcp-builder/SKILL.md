# MCP Builder

Build MCP servers that expose high-value workflows.

## Workflow

1. Study the MCP spec and SDK docs if network access is allowed.
2. Plan tools around workflows, not raw endpoints.
3. Define input schemas, clear outputs, and actionable errors.
4. Implement shared helpers for auth, pagination, and formatting.
5. Add tool annotations and test with realistic scenarios.
