# DDD Planning

Use DDD phases and repo templates.

## Workflow

1. Read existing product docs and extract domain terms.
2. Strategic design: classify domains, define bounded contexts, and map relationships.
3. Tactical design: define aggregates, entities, value objects, domain events, and repositories.
4. Create artifacts with templates from `.claude/skills/ddd-planning/assets/templates/`.
5. Load detailed guidance from `.claude/skills/ddd-planning/references/` as needed.

## Outputs

- Bounded context list and context map.
- Aggregate and domain model drafts.
